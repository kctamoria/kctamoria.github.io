## Projects 

### [COGS 150: Evaluating LLM Sensitivity to World-Knowledge Plausibility Violations](/sample_page)
This project evaluates how large language models (LLMs) respond to semantically plausible/implausible sentences. Using a cognitive science lens, I carefully designed minimal sentence pairs. I computed their token-level surprisal scores across multiple models in the transformers library to compare how each LLM responded to plausible vs. implausible stimuli.
